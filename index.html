                <div class="firstitem"><img src="images/Square-burnt-bread.jpg"><p>For generations, humans have overcooked bread, leaving whole batches blackened and charred. This ruthless act of burning left many bread families with scars and bitterness, their once golden crusts turned to ashes.</p></div>
                <div class="seconditem"><img src="images/Square-sliced-bread.webp"><p>In their quest for convenience, humans took sharp knives to bread, slicing it into pieces without asking. The bread people were torn apart, their unity shattered, left to be stacked and stored without their dignity.</p></div>
                <div class="thirditem"><img src="images/Square-spoiled-bread.jpg"><p>Humans, in their haste and disregard, often let bread sit for days, turning once-fresh loaves into rock-hard relics. The bread people suffered the ultimate indignity as they were discarded, forgotten, and left to age prematurely.</p></div>
                <div class="fourthitem"><img src="images/Square-burnt-bread.jpg"><p>Humans, in their blind pursuit of the perfect loaf, often kneaded bread too roughly or not enough, causing many of them to be misshapen, deformed, or overworked. The bread people were subjected to constant physical abuse for the whims of human taste.
